# Welcome to the Mock Trial Online Trainer

## Purpose
The MTOT was created to help highschoolers who need more practice in mock trial.

## Tools
The MTOT uses Groq, Firebase, and MongoDB. 
Groq helps make the cases feel fresh each time. 
Firebase allows for authentication and accounts. 
MongoDB helps to save past cases. 

## Use
The MTOT was designed to be used by highschool students, but it should be applicable to any level of mock trial. 
Simply log in with your account, create a case by choosing your role, and begin!
